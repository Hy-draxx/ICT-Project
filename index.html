                      <p>Prospective candidates for this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the Direct Entry (DE) programmes who have been battling difficulties in their attempts to register, can now relax as the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has announced a two-week deadline extension for the registration activities. <br>
  
                        This is as the body has also shifted the commencement date for the main examination from the earlier dates of <mark>June 5 to June 19, to June 19 – July 3</mark>. <br>
                        
                        The mock examination, which was earlier scheduled to hold on May 20, will now hold on <mark>June 3</mark>. <br>
                        
                        The registration exercise which had earlier been scheduled to end on May 15, will now end on <mark>May 29</mark>. <br>
                        
                        The new developments are contained in a communique issued at the end of a meeting ohosted by the examination body and held between Friday and Saturday. <br>
                        
                        The JAMB registrar, Is-haq Oloyede, read the communique to journalists in Abuja on Saturday. <br>
                        
                        PREMIUM TIMES had exclusively reported the possibility of adjustments to the examination calendar earlier released by JAMB. <br>
                        
                        Mr Oloyede had on Friday commended this newspaper for its “well informed report” on the challenges being faced by the examination body in its efforts to conduct smooth examination as witnessed in the previous years. <br>
                        
                        The challenges, according to JAMB, are not unconnected to the mandatory use of the unique national identification number (NIN).</p>

                        <p>Prospective candidates for this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and the Direct Entry (DE) programmes who have been battling difficulties in their attempts to register, can now relax as the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has announced a two-week deadline extension for the registration activities. <br>
  
                          This is as the body has also shifted the commencement date for the main examination from the earlier dates of <mark>June 5 to June 19, to June 19 – July 3</mark>. <br>
                          
                          The mock examination, which was earlier scheduled to hold on May 20, will now hold on <mark>June 3</mark>. <br>
                          
                          The registration exercise which had earlier been scheduled to end on May 15, will now end on <mark>May 29</mark>. <br>
                          
                          The new developments are contained in a communique issued at the end of a meeting ohosted by the examination body and held between Friday and Saturday. <br>
                          
                          The JAMB registrar, Is-haq Oloyede, read the communique to journalists in Abuja on Saturday. <br>
                          
                          PREMIUM TIMES had exclusively reported the possibility of adjustments to the examination calendar earlier released by JAMB. <br>
                          
                          Mr Oloyede had on Friday commended this newspaper for its “well informed report” on the challenges being faced by the examination body in its efforts to conduct smooth examination as witnessed in the previous years. <br>
                          
                          The challenges, according to JAMB, are not unconnected to the mandatory use of the unique national identification number (NIN).</p>
